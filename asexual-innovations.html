<ul>
    <li>
        <div>The asexual community has been a source of conceptual and linguistic innovation:
            <ul>
                <li>'Sexual' versus 'asexual' ('sexual' is sometimes called 'allosexual', but with 'allo' meaning other, it doesn't make complete sense and 'sexual' seems to be preferred)</li>
                <li>Split attraction model: romantic versus sexual attraction</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>Focus here is on sexual attraction (and arousal and desire) among sexual people</li>
</ul>
