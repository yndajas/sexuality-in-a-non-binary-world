    <li><span>Traditional definition of fetish: arousal based on anything other than genitals, such as non-living objects or other body parts (e.g. <a href="Freud-1927">Freud 1927</a>)</span></li>
    <li>Definition arising from Kay's discussion: arousal based on anything other than identity</li>

                I'm mostly attracted to women. Uhm, there is a- an attraction to a male response to my femininity that, that I like. I- if a man finds me attractive I find that attractive, but if I'm honest I don't find them attractive. Uhm, and I get the same response from a gay female that's attracted to me - in fact more so cause it's kind of double then. So I- I would say... I don't know you see this is where the lang- language fails, is does that make me straight or gay? Because, my gender identity is 'I don't know'. So yeah, I'm whatever that makes me. I- I find describing myself as gay or trying to describe myself as lesbian would- it is uncomfortable.
