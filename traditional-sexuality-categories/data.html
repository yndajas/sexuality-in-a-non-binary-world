                My sexuality... queer, but I think more recently I’ve been thinking I guess I’m bisexual as well. But I for a long time you know I was- I did call myself a lesbian for a long time, and then felt that wasn’t right because I’m not a woman and not everyone I’m attracted to is a woman and- so then I was like oh just queer and now I’m like well hang on that means bisexual doesn’t it (laughter) so like I don’t know.
                <br><br>
                But then I also think about like uhm homosexual and heterosexual and so like- and for a long time I thought like okay I’m homosexual and then because I used to even be attracted- like I’ve always been fairly kind of butch or like masculine-ish presenting and, uhm, was mostly attracted to other people who were also kind of masculine presenting. Uhm, but I’ve noticed that since I have come out as non-binary and got more comfortable with that I’m definitely attracted to femme women, yeah. And so then I think about well is that homosexual? And it’s like oh I dunno homosexual/heterosexual is meaningless I guess but it’s all these different like it’s more an attraction to difference rather than sameness.

                If you’re doing things off of gender then like you know, I’m not exclusively attracted to men cause there’s non-binary as well and stuff like that, and so you know it all gets really messy using language.

                Thinking about gender in a different way, uhm, it’s sort of changed the way that I think about who I’m attracted to. Uhm, so, it- it’s a bit murky at the moment. Uhm, and yeah I don’t - I don’t have sort of immediate words for- for how I would describe myself. But yeah I suppose probably queer is the c- closest.

                He [my partner] identified as straight when we got together, so that was kind of a big thing to work through like mentally I guess, if that’s what you thought you were and then you are suddenly with a guy.

<ul>
    <li>Partners reconciling a change in their gender (or rather the way they categorise it) and what it means in terms of sexuality. Are you still straight or gay if the person you (still) love and are are sexually attracted to has realised they're trans?</li>
</ul>
