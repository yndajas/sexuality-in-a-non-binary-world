<h2>Assumptions</h2>

<ul>
    <li><span>"Sexual people <i>can</i> experience sexual attraction to people based purely on looking at them" (<a href="/references#Jas-2020">Jas 2020</a>: 78)</span></li>
    <li>Trans women, trans men and non-binary people exist</li>
    <li>Medical ‘transition’ is optional</li>
    <li>
        <div>"[I]dentity, aesthetics and morphology need not align with the norms of gender-conforming cis people. Rather, they have infinite potential combinations" (<a href="/references#Jas-2020">Jas 2020</a>: 78):
            <ul>
                <li>"[F]emme-presenting men who have protruded chests, sometimes hidden by a binder or tape"</li>
                <li>"[W]omen who present neither femme nor masc - or perhaps both - and have a flat chest"</li>
                <li>"[M]asc-presenting non-binary people with large hips who have had a breast reduction"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Problems</h2>

<ul>
    <li><span>"[W]ho or what are (sexual) lesbian, gay and straight people attracted to if women and men can look like anything both clothed and unclothed?" (<a href="/references#Jas-2020">Jas 2020</a>: 78)</span></li>
    <li><span>"Do these categories - under their traditional definitions - retain meaning (or semantic coherence) when we include trans people as potential subjects of sexual attraction?"  (<a href="/references#Jas-2020">Jas 2020</a>: 78)</span></li>
</ul>
