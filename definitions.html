<h2>Gender</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        <div>Bornstein (<a href="/references#Bornstein-2016">2016</a>: 28):
            <ul>
                <li><span><b>Being:</b> "[g]ender identity answers the question: 'Who am I?' Am I a man or a woman or a what?"</span></li>
                <li><span><b>Belonging:</b> "feeling like you belong with people of a particular gender or genders (more than other genders)" (<a href="/references#Jas-2020">Jas 2020</a>: 73)</span></li>
            </ul>

    <li>"[F]elt sense of gender" (<a href="/references#Vincent-2018">Vincent 2018</a>: 18)</li>
    <li>Self-evaluation against own sense of what different gender categories mean (to you)</li>

<h3>Gender system</h3>

<p>The article <a href="https://yndajas.co/articles/2021/02/19/gender-beyond-the-binary-visualisation-language-and-conceptual-frameworks">Gender beyond the binary: visualisation, language and conceptual frameworks</a> outlines my attempt to develop a more comprehensive 'system' of gender and associated categories, including its motivations and a method of mapping gender. Below is a 'system' of gender discussed in that article.</p>

<h2>Sexuality</h2>

<ul>
    <li><span>"[S]exual orientation concerns who one wants to go to bed <i>with</i>, whilst gender identity is who one goes to bed <i>as</i>" (<a href="/references#Vincent-2018">Vincent 2018</a>: 19; emphasis original)</span></li>
    <li><span>Sexuality is more than sexual orientation. Van Anders (<a href="/references#Van-Anders-2015">2015</a>: 1178), in proposing 'Sexual Configurations Theory', wrote:</span></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>"Sexual orientation as defined by gender (or is it sex?) is largely positioned as the singular defining feature of people's sexual selves, but should it be? There are a number of other axes along which sexuality could revolve, including age, partner number, type of sexual activity, consent, solitary sexuality, and intensity among others."</blockquote>

<ul>
    <li>However, focus here is on orientation and what lies beneath</li>
</ul>

<h2>Arousal, attraction and desire</h2>

<ul>
    <li><span><b>Arousal:</b> sexual excitement</span></li>
    <li><span><b>Attraction:</b> appreciation of specific qualities</span></li>
    <li><span><b>Desire:</b> want for sex</span></li>
</ul>

<h2>Queer</h2>

<p>My position, somewhat in contrast to orthodox queer theory:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Queer can be many things, including an identity category (not anti-identity)</li>
    <li>Support for subjective, non-prescriptive definition</li>
    <li>However, identity categories are not everything: individuals are more than the groups to which they belong</li>
</ul>
