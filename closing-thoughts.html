        <div>'Queer' is a great catch-all, recognising that sexuality is complicated and messy, but it has limitations:
            <ul>
                <li>Obfuscation of what's going on underneath</li>
                <li>Lack of visibility for less well known or understood sexualities</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>Specifity and more open discussion about what lies beneath sexuality can counter that</li>
    <li>
        <div>However, care must be taken over the dangers of specificity. Preference can open up potential for prejudice:
            <ul>
                <li>Morphology: ableism, fatphobia and racism</li>
                <li>Aesthetics: femmephobia</li>
                <li>Character: ableism (e.g. sapiosexual)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>Intersectional perspectives are vital when considering linguistic innovation</li>
</ul>

        <img src="/assets/images/paperinameme.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Meme with five rows of image and text, with each image representing an increasingly complex mind. In the first row, the text reads &quot;i'm gay&quot;. In the second row, the text reads &quot;i'm biromantic and homosexual&quot;. In the third row, the text reads &quot;my sexuality isn't a rigid set of rules and there will always be exceptions so i just say i'm queer&quot;. In the fourth row, the text reads &quot;the entire concept of sexual orientation reinforces a limited understanding of gender, & since gender doesn't equal appearance there's no way to define often visual-based attraction in terms of gender, unless through words like femme & masc which still perpetuate a binary&quot;. In the fifth row, the text reads &quot;i'm gay&quot;.">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">A meme I encountered that summarises a lot of the discussion in this paper, and also follows a trend of reappropriating "gay" as a catch-all in place of "queer".</figcaption>
