<ul>
    <li>
        <div>'Queer' is a great catch-all, recognising that sexuality is complicated and messy, but it has limitations:
            <ul>
                <li>Obfuscation of what's going on underneath</li>
                <li>Lack of visibility for less well known or understood sexualities</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>Specifity and more open discussion about what lies beneath sexuality can counter that</li>
    <li>
        <div>However, care must be taken over the dangers of specificity. Preference can open up potential for prejudice:
            <ul>
                <li>Morphology: ableism, fatphobia and racism</li>
                <li>Aesthetics: femmephobia</li>
                <li>Character: ableism (e.g. sapiosexual)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>Intersectional perspectives are vital when considering linguistic innovation</li>
</ul>
