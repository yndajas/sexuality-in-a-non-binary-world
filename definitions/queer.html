<h2>Queer</h2>

<p>My position, somewhat in contrast to orthodox queer theory:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Queer can be many things, including an identity category (not anti-identity)</li>
    <li>Support for subjective, non-prescriptive definition</li>
    <li>However, identity categories are not everything: individuals are more than the groups to which they belong</li>
</ul>
