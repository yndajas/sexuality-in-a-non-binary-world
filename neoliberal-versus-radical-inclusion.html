<h2>Tinder and OkCupid: ownership, approaches and press</h2>

<ul>
    <li><span>Tinder: same owner as OkCupid, almost identical approach. Tinder however uses the language of "show" (on profile) versus "include" (in searches) - genders beyond the binary can be <i>shown</i> but not <i>included</i></span></li>
    <li>
        <div><i>Showing</i> is enough to get good press. One of many example articles reads (<a href="/references#Smith-2014">Smith 2014</a>):
            <ul>
                <li>"OKCupid [sic] Just Exploded The Gender Binary With a Huge New Range of Orientation Options"</li>
                <li>"OKCupid [...] has just laid down the gauntlet when it comes to inclusivity"</li>
                <li>"[T]he changes that OKCupid has just started rolling out to users are revolutionary"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Barriers</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        <div>Types of inclusion:
            <ul>
                <li><span><b>Liberal:</b> making small changes within the existing framework</span></li>
                <li><span><b>Radical:</b> changing the system</span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>Liberal approach of OkCupid, Tinder and many organisations beyond the dating app domain highlights three major barriers:
            <ul>
                <li><span>Willingness to accept/tolerate, but not challenge underlying assumptions about gender and the world (<a href="/references#Nicholas-2019">Nicholas 2019</a>)</span></li>
                <li><span>"The ubiquity of binary gender in how we conceptualise sexuality" (<a href="/references#Jas-2020">Jas 2020</a>: 76). Updating search algorithms may create work for users in (re)evaluating who they see as potential matches, leading to ontological instability</span></li>
                <li><span>"[T]he neoliberal agenda, which puts profit over people (<a href="/references#Chomsky-1999">Chomsky 1999</a>)" (<a href="/references#Jas-2020">Jas 2020</a>: 76). It's profitable to look progressive, less so to work out the details, and potentially confuse the core userbase of cisgender straight and LGB people by calling into question those very categories</span></li>
            </ul>            
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>Companies that do this kind of virtue signalling often receive significant praise, which makes it harder for community members to be heard when calling for more meaningful changes</li>
</ul>
