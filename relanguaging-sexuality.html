<ul>
    <li>Gender is more complicated than traditional sexuality categories can account for</li>
    <li>"[W]e cannot consistently accurately identify the gender of individuals" (<a href="/references#Jas-2020">Jas 2020</a>: 85)</li>
    <li>So "how can we describe what we are attracted to and aroused by without relying on essentialist understandings of identity?" (<a href="/references#Jas-2020">Jas 2020</a>: 86)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Identity</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        <div>If we include fetishes, identity could be a form of idea-based arousal or attraction to:
            <ul>
                <li>a specific gender (androsexual, gynosexual and skoliosexual)</li>
                <li>sameness (gay)</li>
                <li>difference (straight)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>If fetishes are out, "such labels fall down at the 'Who are guys?' question" (<a href="/references#Jas-2020">Jas 2020</a>: 86)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Morphology</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Again rests on sexuality-fetish distinction</li>
    <li><span>Sex, like gender, is complicated and not truly binary in nature (<a href="/references#Blackless-2000">Blackless et al. 2000</a>; <a href="/references#Vincent-2018">Vincent 2018</a>) - AFAB and AMAB are insufficient as a proxy for morphology)</span></li>
    <li>Categorisation is difficult - describe specific aspects of morphology?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Aesthetics and character</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        <div>'Femme' and 'masc' are popular, but there are issues:
            <ul>
                <li>Still a binary that can't capture the true diversity of expression</li>
                <li>"[H]ighly culturally-contextualised [and] subject to individual interpretation" (<a href="/references#Jas-2020">Jas 2020</a>: 87)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>More specificity; potential for more nuanced neologisms?</li>
</ul>
