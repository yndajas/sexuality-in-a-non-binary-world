<ul>
    <li><span>"Language is important: some words hurt and are best avoided. But that hurt is culturally contextual, not universal: words that are harmful within one context may be entirely benign in another (<a href="/references#Butler-1993">Butler 1993</a>)" (<a href="/references#Jas-2020">Jas 2020</a>: 81)</span></li>
    <li><span>There exist "different languages of gender and sexuality in both 'Western' (e.g. <a href="/references/Valentine-2007">Valentine 2007</a>) and non-'Western' cultures (e.g. <a href="/references/Jackson-1989">Jackson 1989</a>; <a href="/references/Kulick-1998">Kulick 1998</a>) [...] our conceptual frameworks and resulting language are rarely if ever one-size-fits-all" (<a href="/references#Jas-2020">Jas 2020</a>: 81)</span></li>
    <li><span>Throw out existing (Anglospheric) language and look at what lies beneath</span></li>

<h2>Identity</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        <div>Identity is self-described
            <ul>
                <li><span>"[A]nyone can be anything and identify any way they like (with regard to gender)" (<a href="/references#Jas-2020">Jas 2020</a>: 81)</span></li>
                <li><span>Logically, identity <i>shouldn't</i> be a factor in attraction</span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>However, might character or personality matter?</li>
    <li>Could identity actually play a role in fetishes? Do fetishes even fall within the domain of attraction and orientation?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Aesthetics</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Aesthetics are usually the first thing you see on a dating app, and attraction at first sight - with no further knowledge - is entirely possible</li>
    <li>Where do you draw the line between aesthetics and morphology?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Morphology</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Common to think of gender and morphology as aligned, which leads to viewing 'lesbian', 'gay' and 'straight' as attraction to particular types of bodies</li>
    <li>Trans people complicate this - an attraction to a particular type of body does not equal an attraction to a particular gender</li>
    <li><span>Are these categories only <i>ostensibly</i> gender-based, and actually about morphology?</span></li>
    <li>Some trans people view claims of morphological preference as biologically essentialist and problematic, e.g. Kay below</li>

                From my own personal experience, I'd say uhm there are a lot of issues around gender and making assumptions about people's gender uhm and people saying accidentally transphobic things. Uhm genital fetishism is a big thing within the queer scene that uhm isn't helpful for trans people I think. There's a certain extent to which you can't necessarily control your fetishes, but uhm I think uh some people feel that part of their gay identity means uhm being very explicit about the type of genitals you want on the person that you're attracted to which I don't think is helpful for trans people. Uhm so yeah biological essentialism basically is uhm one of the main issues both within society and within queer groups that I think really needs to be tackled.
